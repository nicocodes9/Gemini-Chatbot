> **Security Note:** For production, store your API key as an environment variable instead of hardcoding it.



### 4. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```sh
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/chatbot-project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
````
